Simple firewall kernel module using netfilters. The filtering rules and the web-server IP address are hardcoded for simplicity. 

###################### Problem definition ###############################################
You have recently become part of this small organization and want to protect its network
from some common attacks. After reviewing common threats you decide that a simple
firewall with the following rules will provide your network sufficient protection.
Firewall Rules:
1. Block all ICMP packets coming in from outside except the ones going to the webserver.
Though the local hosts should be able to ping outside.
2. Block all ssh attempts from outside.
3. Block port 80 (http) access from outside except for the web-server and test that an
internal website on a local host is only accessible from inside.
Implement a simple firewall as a linux kernel module with only 3 rules identified above.
Get familiar with the Netfilter framework that provides hooks for you to filter packets
and then take actions like drop or accept.
